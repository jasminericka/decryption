DECRYPTION

This Python code is designed to decrypt text that has been encrypted using a specific substitution cipher. The code takes an input string from the user and replaces the symbols *, &, #, +=, and ! with the corresponding vowels a, e, i, o, and u, respectively. This code is useful for quickly deciphering coded messages without having to manually substitute each symbol for its corresponding vowel.
